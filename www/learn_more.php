		<h1>About Ocean</h1>

		<h2>The Foundations of Ocean</h2>
		<p>Ocean was created by DCC, Inc., a partnership of four sexy young web developers: Richie, 
			Joey P., CC, and Ringo Starr.  The group decided to go about creating the site based on an
			idea for a completely anonymous, no-strings-attached messaging pool they called "Message 
			In A Bottle".  As the idea evolved, a chat aspect was integrated into the user experience, and
			the project was renamed <span class="italic">theocean</span>.  However, at the advice of Justin
			Timberlake in the film <span class="italic">The Social Network</span>, the name was again
			changed to the sleeker, cleaner <span class="italic">Ocean</span>.</p>
		<p>There was work ahead, but the four heroes knew that they could accomplish 
			anything with Richie's young money millions, Joey's neuroticism, CCs itchiness, and Ringo's 
			extensive experience developing Certified Safe Spaces (CSS).</p>

		<h2>Ocean's Features</h2>
		<p>Currently, Ocean doesn't have that many features, and basically consists only of a login and 
			a page where users can create accounts.  More on this later.</p>
